Second Largest Element
100
Hint
Given an array of integers nums, return the second-largest element in the array. If the second-largest element does not exist, return -1.


Examples:
Input: nums = [8, 8, 7, 6, 5]

Output: 7

Explanation: The largest value in nums is 8, the second largest is 7

Input: nums = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]

Output: -1

Explanation: The only value in nums is 10, so there is no second largest value, thus -1 is returned
