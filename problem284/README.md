Write a Java program to generate the following pattern based on the input number n:

The pattern starts with the number 1.

Each subsequent line describes the previous line in terms of the count of consecutive digits followed by the digit itself.

This is similar to the "Look-and-say" sequence but with space-separated counts and digits printed in each line.

ðŸ§ª Example:
If the input n = 5, the output should be:

Copy
Edit
1
1 1
2 1
1 2 1 1
1 1 1 2 2 1
