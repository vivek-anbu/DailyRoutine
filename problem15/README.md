Floor in a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array arr[] (with unique elements) and an integer k, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to k. This element is called the "floor" of k. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], k = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: No element less than 0 is found. So output is -1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Largest Number less than 5 is 2 , whose index is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Largest Number less than or equal to  1 is 1 , whose index is 0.
