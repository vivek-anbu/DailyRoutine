Sort Array by Frequency
Problem Statement:
Given an array, sort its elements based on their frequency in descending order. If two elements have the same frequency, preserve their original order.

Example 1:
Input: {2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 12, 2, 3, 3, 3, 12}
Output: {3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5}

Example 2:
Input: {0, 2, 1, -1, 1, 2, 0, 4, -1, 4}
Output: {-1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4}

Example 3:
Input: {4, 6, 8, 2, 5, 7, 9}
Output: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
