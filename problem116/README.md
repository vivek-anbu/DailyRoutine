Given an array, arr[]. Sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
Input: arr[] = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: An array that is already sorted should remain unchanged after applying bubble sort.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 103
