 Given a sliding window of size k print the maximum of the numbers under
 the sliding window.
 Example: Consider a sliding window of size k equals 3. Let the array be 
[3,2,7,6,5,1,2,3,4] the output should print 7 as the first output as first window 
contains {3,2,7} and second window contains {2,7,6} and so on and the final output 
is {7,7,7,6,5,3,4}
