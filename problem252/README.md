Pre, Post, Inorder in one traversal
100
Hint
Given a binary tree with root node. Return the In-order,Pre-order and Post-order traversal of the binary tree.


Examples:
Input : root = [1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 7, 6 ]

Output : [ [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4, 6] , [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6] , [5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 1] ]

Explanation : The In-order traversal is [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4, 6].

The Pre-order traversal is [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6].

The Post-order traversal is [5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 1].





Input : root = [1, 2, 3, null, null, null, 6 ]

Output : [ [2, 1, 3, 6] , [1, 2, 3, 6] , [2, 6, 3, 1] ]

Explanation : The In-order traversal is [2, 1, 3, 6].

The Pre-order traversal is [1, 2, 3, 6].

The Post-order traversal is [2, 6, 3, 1].
