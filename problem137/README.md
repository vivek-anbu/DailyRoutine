Hint
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum and return the sum of the elements present in that subarray.



A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.


Examples:
Input: nums = [2, 3, 5, -2, 7, -4]

Output: 15

Explanation: The subarray from index 0 to index 4 has the largest sum = 15

Input: nums = [-2, -3, -7, -2, -10, -4]

Output: -2

Explanation: The element on index 0 or index 3 make up the largest sum when taken as a subarray
