Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 52.94%Submissions: 126K+Points: 4
Given an infix expression in the form of string s. Convert this infix expression to a postfix expression.

Infix expression: The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is in between every pair of operands.
Postfix expression: The expression of the form a b op. When an operator is followed for every pair of operands.
Note: The order of precedence is: ^ greater than * equals to / greater than + equals to -. Ignore the right associativity of ^.

Examples :

Input: s = "a+b*(c^d-e)^(f+g*h)-i"
Output: abcd^e-fgh*+^*+i-
Explanation: After converting the infix expression into postfix expression, the resultant expression will be abcd^e-fgh*+^*+i-
Input: s = "A*(B+C)/D"
Output: ABC+*D/
Explanation: After converting the infix expression into postfix expression, the resultant expression will be ABC+*D/
Input: s = "(a+b)*(c+d)"
Output: ab+cd+*
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.length ≤ 30
